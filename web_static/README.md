# AirBnB Clone - web static

## Description

Web static development involves creating static HTML pages and applying styles using CSS. The main goal is to learn how to work with HTML and CSS. This process includes building the front end step-by-step by first creating simple HTML static pages and then applying styles with CSS. You will also create style guides and use placeholder content, all without using JavaScript. This helps you focus on understanding how HTML and CSS work together.

## Additional Notes

### 1. **What is HTML?**
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create webpages. It provides the structure of a webpage by defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other content.

### 2. **How to Create an HTML Page?**
An HTML page is created using a simple text editor (like Notepad or VS Code). You start with a basic structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
This is a basic HTML document, which includes the document type, head (metadata), and body (content).

### 3. **What is a Markup Language?**
A markup language is a language used to annotate or structure text so that it can be interpreted by a computer. HTML is a markup language because it "marks up" text with tags to define the structure of a webpage.

### 4. **What is the DOM?**
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can manipulate its structure, style, and content. When you load a webpage, the browser converts the HTML into a DOM, which can then be accessed and changed through JavaScript.

### 5. **What is an Element / Tag?**
An **element** (or **tag**) is a fundamental building block in HTML. It defines a piece of content on the page. For example, `<h1>` is an element used for headings, and `<p>` is used for paragraphs. Elements are usually written with opening and closing tags:
```html
<h1>Heading Text</h1>
```

### 6. **What is an Attribute?**
An **attribute** provides additional information about an HTML element. It is placed inside the opening tag of the element. For example, the `src` attribute in an `<img>` tag specifies the image source:
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="An example image">
```
In this case, `src` and `alt` are attributes of the `<img>` element.

### 7. **How Does the Browser Load a Webpage?**
When you enter a URL in the browser:
1. The browser sends a request to the web server.
2. The server responds with the HTML, CSS, and any other files required (like images or scripts).
3. The browser parses the HTML, builds the DOM, and then uses CSS to apply styles.
4. JavaScript (if used) may execute to add interactivity.
5. The page is displayed on your screen.

### 8. **What is CSS?**
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the presentation (style) of a webpage, including colors, fonts, layout, and spacing. It works alongside HTML to make a webpage look appealing.

### 9. **How to Add Style to an Element?**
To add style to an element, you use CSS. This can be done in three ways:
- **Inline:** Add CSS directly within an element using the `style` attribute.
  ```html
  <p style="color: red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
  ```
- **Internal:** Include CSS inside a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` of the document.
  ```html
  <style>
      p { color: red; }
  </style>
  ```
- **External:** Link to a separate CSS file using the `<link>` tag.
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  ```

### 10. **What is a Class?**
A **class** is a way to group elements with similar styles. It is defined in CSS and can be applied to HTML elements using the `class` attribute. For example:
```html
<p class="highlight">This paragraph has a highlight class.</p>
```
In the CSS file, you would define the class like this:
```css
.highlight {
    color: yellow;
    background-color: black;
}
```

### 11. **What is a Selector?**
A **selector** in CSS is used to target HTML elements that you want to style. The most common types of selectors are:
- **Element selector:** Targets elements by their tag name (`p`, `h1`, etc.)
- **Class selector:** Targets elements by their class name (`.highlight`)
- **ID selector:** Targets an element by its ID (`#main`)
```css
p {
    font-size: 16px;
}

.highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
}

#main {
    margin-top: 20px;
}
```

### 12. **How to Compute CSS Specificity Value?**
CSS specificity determines which styles are applied when multiple rules target the same element. Specificity is calculated based on a simple system:
1. Inline styles have the highest specificity (e.g., `style="color:red;"`).
2. ID selectors (`#id`) have a higher specificity than class selectors.
3. Class selectors (`.class`), attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes have lower specificity than IDs.
4. Element selectors (`p`, `div`) have the lowest specificity.

For example, an ID selector (`#header`) has more specificity than a class selector (`.menu`).

### 13. **What are Box Properties in CSS?**
The **box model** in CSS describes how elements are structured on the page. It consists of the following properties:
- **Content:** The actual content of the element (text, images, etc.).
- **Padding:** The space between the content and the border.
- **Border:** The edge of the element, surrounding the padding.
- **Margin:** The space outside the border, separating the element from others.
  
These properties define how an element’s size and spacing behave. Here's an example:
```css
div {
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 2px solid black;
    margin: 15px;
}
```
This will create a `div` with 200px width and 100px height, 10px padding inside the box, a 2px border, and 15px space around the outside.
